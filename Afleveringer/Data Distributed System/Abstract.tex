When different computers in a network want to share data regardless to the application-language it can be advisable to use a middleware. This software, installed on every implicated computer, offers an interface to the physical layer which hides the problems that can occur due to different application languages, hardware or operating systems.\\The middleware can be implemented by using a standard, e.g. the middleware "Connext" is an implementation of the DDS standard which uses a data-centric publish/subscribe communication paradigm. The DDS consists of different entities which ensure that data on one application can be obtained by another computer in the domain. By using Quality of Service-parameters it is possible to specify which data is wanted.
