\section{Conclusion}
%Conlude on your investigations.

The DNS system is a cleaver solution to the original problem; connecting computers to the internet.
In many aspects the system is brilliant to resolving which IP the resolver is looking for which is done very fast and easy for the client.




\section{Discussion}
% Discuss your project work.


The internet is a great system used by millions of computers every day and DNS servers are one of the main factors for its accessibility. 
Due to this fact it is necessary that no politic organization can shut down the servers to prevent the citizen the access to the internet.
\\
Security measures has been taken but a country like China has found loopholes to censor part of the internet, setting up \textit{Deep Packet Inspection} near all international gateways and searching for certain keyword, they  return bad IP-addresses before the correct is returned\cite{GFW}.

If it was "only" China's population who could not access certain websites it would be relativly controlled problem, but if a computer in South Korea request a website and it's the root DNS server in China which must resolve the IP -- South Korea is suddenly also affected.


\section{Perspectives}
What are the perspectives on the technology and your prototype?
