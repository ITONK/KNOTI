\chapter{Introduction}
The course on object oriented network communication is concerning distributed systems which consists of multiple computers that communicate through a computer network. In order to communicate with each other the computers need to be able to connect via an IP address. The translation/resolution from logical names to IP addresses is handled by a Domain Name Server.\vspace{10pt}

This report will cover the subject of the Domain Name Server; the fundamentals about this technique, how it is working and the security issues associated with it.\vspace{10pt}

Chapter 2 contains a theoretical description of the Domain Name Server including screen shots and code examples.\vspace{10pt}

Chapter 3 contains a practical example of an implementation of a Domain Name Server and how it can be used to filter certain internet sites and get faster response by using a caching domain name server.
