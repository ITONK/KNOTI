Domain Name System (DNS) enables you to locate computers and other resources on a network using human friendly logical names. The DNS is a distributed database that contains mappings of the logical names into IP addresses.\\This request/response transaction can either be iterative or recursive and the security of the transaction is defined in the digital signature-based DNS Security extensions.


It can be feasible for schools, small companies or at home to install the software Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND); the most common implementation of the DNS. BIND can resolve name queries, filter unwanted websites or forward queries to desirable public DNS's.
