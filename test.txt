Two main security threats exist for
DNS in the context of query/
response transactions. Attackers can
• spoof authoritative name servers
responding to DNS queries and
alter DNS responses, and
• alter the DNS responses stored in
caching name servers. Therefore DNSSEC was designed to protect the users from obtaining corrupted DNS data. It contains a set of extensions to DNS which provide origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.
